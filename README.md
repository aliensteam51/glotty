# Glotty

Glotty is a translation tool developped for [Aliens Are Among Us](http://www.aliensareamongus.com/).

It was developed by [Oliver Winter](https://github.com/owinter86), [Steve (Ziv) Galili](http://github.com/vanGalilea), and [Han Kortekaas](https://github.com/Hansterdam).

It helps developers to manage the localization of their applications. Already existing projects can be added by importing iOS Strings, Android XML, or i18n JSON files.
Or new projects can be created. New locales can be added to a project and then be exported for your platform of choice (iOS, Android, i18n).
It's also possible to create platform specific translations or keys, for optimal customization.

## Technology used
The front-end is a react app, bootstrapped with create-react-app. Using Foundation.

The back-end is a FeathersJS application.
